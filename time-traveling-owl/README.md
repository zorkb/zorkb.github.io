# time-traveling-owl
an arguably fun game about an owl who travels through time.

concept: 

you adopt an owl who loves food, entertainment, and travelling through the fabric of space-time. 

steps:

the game begins when your owl is just an egg. keep the egg warm and your owl will hatch!

give your owl a name - it will be displayed on screen and used in prompts.
feed your owl  and make sure to give it academic philosophy to read so it stays entertained. you will have options of different owl food and books to give your owl. if your owl doesn’t eat or read for a certain amount of time, he will leave from hunger/boredom. 
your owl also needs rest - be sure to let it sleep, but it's all about number of sleep sessions, so be sure to wake it after.
if any category = 10, owl leaves
if you reach 25 days of owl care, you win.
at any time, the user can change to a new time and place. that’s the benefit of having a time-traveling pet.
new time/places are randomly generated from an image array when the time-travel button is clicked.

code

the code makes use of objects for the day counter and the owl's stats. setInterval was used to count up, while button presses decrement the stats when pressed. jquery's .show and .hide are used throughout to create a more interactive walkthrough experience.
